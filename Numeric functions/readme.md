# Data Analysis Insights ðŸ“Š

Data analysis is a process that involves collection, examination, cleaning, transformation, interpretation, and visualization of data
to make informed decisions.
In my journey to master data analysis, I've had the privilege of working with a diverse set of tools:
- Excel: A versatile and widely-used spreadsheet tool.
- MySQL: A robust relational database management system.
- Pandas (Python): An essential library for data manipulation and analysis.
  
Here are some files that uses various tools to perform same function:
- [Sales.xlsx](https://github.com/akikl/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Numeric%20functions/Sales.xlsx) - Excel file
- [Linkedin1.sql](https://github.com/akikl/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Numeric%20functions/Linkedin1.sql) -Sql file
- [using_pandas.py](https://github.com/akikl/Data-Analysis/blob/main/Numeric%20functions/using_pandas.py) - pandas file
  
Throughout my exploration, I dove deep into numeric functions that serve as the bedrock of data analysis:
## Numeric functions explored:
- COUNTA() 
- SUM()
- MAX()
- MIN()
- AVERAGE(). 

What's truly fascinating is the remarkable consistency in results obtained from Excel, MySQL, and Pandas, despite minor differences in syntax and implementation. 
This underscores the adaptability of these tools while reinforcing the idea that the path to meaningful data insights can take different routes.
